                <p class="text"><br>After walking through the forested patch for some time, the forests will eventually give way to grasslands and you can see some local vendors with their tea stalls. These stalls also sell Rhododendron syrup, which is mixed with water to make a very refreshing drink. Grahan village is not very far. From here, it is about a steep climb of one hour before you enter the picturesque village <br><br>Grahan is situated at the top of a hill and we will camp here for the night. Mobile coverage is sometimes available in Grahan but it is very erratic. The campsite is surrounded by Rhododendron trees making it look even more beautiful. After having a delicious lunch at the campsite, you can go about exploring the quaint village and its surroundings. The pleasantness of the scenery with the beautiful mountain views will captivate you. After a delectable dinner, you will retire to your tents ending the first day of trekking.<br></p>

                </div>
                    <p class="text"><br>Today we will trek to Min Thach, a beautiful meadow that falls en route to your trek. To reach Min Thach, we will follow the trail that goes north from our campsite at Grahan, this path will lead you to Min Thach. We will start our trek post a hearty breakfast at the Grahan campsite.&nbsp;After walking for some time, wonderful mountain views begin to open up and the trail to Min Thach will be on your right.,<br><br> The climb to the meadow is a little steep and sometimes the trail becomes a little confusing, follow your trek leader’s instructions during these confusing patches. After walking for a few hours through the dense forests, it will open into a grassy ridge, this is Min Thach clearing and we will find a proper location here and pitch our tents for an overnight stay. Min Thach is usually used by locals to graze their cattle.<br></p>

                    </div>
                        <p class="text">After a couple of hours of trekking through varied terrains, you will arrive at a flatland on the top of a hill, this is Nagaru. As soon as you reach Nagaru, you will be totally amazed by the sight lying ahead of you. All of a sudden it seems like you have entered a different world from the one you have been trekking in so far! On the northern side, you can see the majestic mountains rising from the Parvati Valley down below. <br><br>The Chanderkheni Ranges simply look magnificent and the Beas Valley with its greenery is amazing too. On your left, down below, you can see a bird’s eye view of Min Thach and Grahan village and to your south, you can see the vast expanse of snow up to the mountains. This is the direction you will trek in next to reach Sar Pass. The winds are very strong at Nagaru and the temperature drops pretty quickly so it is wise to set up the camps as soon as possible.<br></p>
